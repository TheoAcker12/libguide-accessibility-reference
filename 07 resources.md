## General Information

### Guides and Tutorials

-   [Introduction to Web Accessibility - W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/) Provides a lot of useful general information. A good place to start.
-   [Introduction to Web Accessibility - WebAIM](https://webaim.org/intro/)
-   [Accessibility Guide - Penn State University](https://accessibility.psu.edu/)
-   [Penn State Webinar Archives](https://accessibility.psu.edu/training/eventslist/webinars/)
-   [Princeton Accessibility Guide](https://accessibility.princeton.edu/how/content)
-   [Improving Workplace Accessibility for Deaf/Hard of Hearing Colleagues](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kSeISZt8UHLRx85emr3E7LIGoyvWhbPsFZIxN553Duk)
-   [Tables Tutorial](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/) A tutorial for creating different types of tables accessibly using HTML
-   [Images Tutorial](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/) An incredible tutorial on alternative text by WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative). Much of the text in this section came directly from here.  When reading the section about complex images, note that approach 4 is not recommended, as longdesc should not be used.
-   [Alternative Text](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/) An excellent guide from WebAIM (Web Accessibility In Mind) for writing alternative text.

### Documentation

-   [WCAG Quick Reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) You might find this really useful as a highly organized list of criteria, or you might find it overwhelming starting out, fair warning. This is the basis for most guidelines out there, and many testing tools will reference the various WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) requirements a given issue pertains to. Produced by W3C - the World Wide Web Consortium, so this is very official.
-   [ATAG (Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines)](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/) This is similar to WCAG, and also produced by W3C. This documentation is probably primarily useful to web developers creating any kind of authoring tool, but it may also be useful when considering the accessibility of any given authoring tool.
-   [COGA (Cognitive Accessibility).](https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/) Also produced by W3C, this focuses on a facet of accessibility that is often neglected.
-   [ARIA Authoring Practices (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) ARIA is somewhat advanced - if you aren't a web developer, this may be quite overwhelming and unnecessary. MDN's documentation provides a broader overview.
-   [MDN ARIA Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) This may be a better choice for a broader, more understandable overview of ARIA than the WAI ARIA documentation, but I still imagine most people would not want to go this far.

### Articles and Discussion

-   [Knowbility Blog - AHA Moment](https://knowbility.org/blog/2020/create-your-own-aha-moment/) This post is a good intro for people unfamiliar with accessibility and the importance of it. Offers good tips for investigating it and seeing for yourself.

-   [Overly Accessible?](https://webaim.org/blog/overly-accessible/) Is it possible for a web page to be overly accessible?

-   [United States Laws](https://webaim.org/articles/laws/usa/) A brief introduction to key US laws pertinent to web accessibility
-   [The Business Case for Digital Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/)
